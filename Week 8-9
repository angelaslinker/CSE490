Over the past two weeks, I've been focused on developing the sign-up page for our project, which involved learning how to use Android Studio and integrating my work with my teammates'. It's been a challenging yet rewarding process, as I've not only gained new technical skills but also helped ensure our project progresses smoothly by assisting my team with uploading their code. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining our work and supporting my team as needed.
